MiniJSON is a codec for a compact binary representation of a superset of JSON
(binary values) are supported.

Note
----

Active development of **minijson** is moved to this fork.
[Dronehub](https://github.com/Dronehub) has no interest in further developing this awesome
technology.

Usage
-----

Refer to the [documentation](http://minijson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
for use.

If there are no binary wheels precompiled for this platform, you will need to
compile it yourself.
Alternatively, you can
[file an issue](https://github.com/smok-serwis/minijson/issues/new)
and I'll do my best to compile a wheel for you.

Compiling own wheels
--------------------

If there's no wheel, and you'd like to compile it on your own, you'll
require [Cython](https://cython.org/) installed.

Run the Dockerfile to launch unit tests locally.
